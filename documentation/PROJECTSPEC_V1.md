**Project Title: WeatherWise ‚Äî Your Personal Weather Dashboard**

WeatherWise is a simple yet powerful desktop application designed to bring real-time weather forecasting and historical weather data directly to your screen. Built with Python and powered by the Open-Meteo API, this app makes weather tracking both accessible and user-friendly‚Äîeven for those who aren‚Äôt particularly tech-savvy.

The primary goal of this project is to deliver an intuitive interface for viewing current weather, hourly and daily forecasts, and historical climate trends in any location worldwide. Users will be able to input a city or coordinates, and the application will display up-to-date information like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and even UV index. For weather enthusiasts and casual users alike, this tool provides everything needed to plan their day‚Äîor week‚Äîaccordingly.

In version 1, WeatherWise will be developed as a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, allowing users to enter commands like weather --location "New York" or forecast --days 5 --location "Los Angeles". It will fetch data from the Open-Meteo API and output clean, human-readable summaries in the terminal. This minimal version ensures rapid development and testing without needing to design a user interface initially.

Eventually, the application will evolve into a full-featured desktop GUI using Python‚Äôs tkinter library, providing a clickable interface with maps, charts, and forecast timelines. For a more modern experience, a web version may be considered, using Flask as the backend and a lightweight frontend framework such as Streamlit or plain HTML/CSS templates enhanced with Bootstrap for responsiveness and design consistency.

WeatherWise will rely on external mechanisms such as RESTful API calls to Open-Meteo, JSON parsing, and optional email integration for daily weather summaries. With the flexibility of Python and the robustness of open weather APIs, this app aims to be both a practical daily tool and a stepping stone into more advanced data visualization projects.

**Vignettes**

‚∏ª

**Vignette 1: Checking Today‚Äôs Weather**

Maria opens her laptop and wants to know if she should bring an umbrella before leaving for work. She opens the terminal and types:

weather --location "Chicago"

Within seconds, the app responds with a summary:
‚ÄúToday in Chicago: 67¬∞F, light rain, winds 10 mph NE. UV index: 4. Carry an umbrella just in case.‚Äù
Satisfied, she grabs her umbrella and heads out the door.

Technical Details:
	‚Ä¢	User inputs a location as a string (city or coordinates).
	‚Ä¢	The system sends a request to the Open-Meteo API /forecast endpoint with current weather data parameters.
	‚Ä¢	JSON data is parsed and formatted for clean CLI display.
	‚Ä¢	Future GUI version will show weather in cards with icons and background illustrations.
	‚Ä¢	Geolocation logic will later be added to allow for default location detection.

‚∏ª

**Vignette 2: Viewing a 7-Day Forecast**

Later in the evening, Maria wants to plan a weekend hike. She types:

forecast --location "Denver" --days 7

A simple table appears in the terminal showing daily high/low temperatures, precipitation chances, and wind speeds for the next week. She sees sunny skies ahead and confirms her plans.

Technical Details:
	‚Ä¢	CLI command triggers API call to Open-Meteo‚Äôs 7-day forecast endpoint.
	‚Ä¢	Daily data is looped through and formatted as a simple table in terminal output.
	‚Ä¢	Units (Fahrenheit/Celsius, MPH/KPH) configurable via optional flag.
	‚Ä¢	Future GUI version will use line graphs or scrollable cards for day-by-day forecast.
	‚Ä¢	Backend caching can be added to reduce repeated API calls for same location.

‚∏ª

**Vignette 3: Checking Historical Weather Trends**

Carlos is a data nerd planning a garden. He wants to know how rainy May was in his city over the past 3 years. He enters:

history --location "Seattle" --month "May" --years 3

The app returns average rainfall, number of rainy days, and temperature ranges for each year. He compares and starts planning the perfect planting schedule.

Technical Details:
	‚Ä¢	Command queries Open-Meteo‚Äôs historical weather data endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	App calculates averages and displays basic stats for comparison.
	‚Ä¢	Requires date parsing and possibly multiple requests (for each year).
	‚Ä¢	Future versions could offer CSV export or basic charts.
	‚Ä¢	CLI version outputs plain text, GUI might show bar charts or plots.

‚∏ª

**Vignette 4: Receiving Daily Email Summaries**

Avery prefers to check weather via email. During setup, she types:

weather --subscribe --location "San Diego" --email "avery@email.com"

The app confirms: ‚ÄúSubscribed! You‚Äôll receive daily weather summaries at 7 AM.‚Äù
Each morning, an email lands in her inbox with a forecast and outfit suggestion.

Technical Details:
	‚Ä¢	Requires basic user input validation for email and location.
	‚Ä¢	Will use a third-party email API (e.g., SendGrid, SMTP).
	‚Ä¢	Scheduler (e.g., cron, apscheduler) needed to automate daily job.
	‚Ä¢	For MVP, email body is plaintext; future enhancement may include rich HTML templates.
	‚Ä¢	User preferences stored in local JSON or SQLite DB.

‚∏ª

**Vignette 5: Getting Severe Weather Alerts**

Jamal is a cyclist who needs real-time alerts about storms. He activates alert mode:

weather --alerts --location "Austin"

The app starts monitoring hourly forecast data and, upon detecting high winds or thunderstorms, pushes a desktop notification and logs it:
‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Alert: Severe Thunderstorm expected in 2 hours.‚Äù

Technical Details:
	‚Ä¢	Monitors forecast API for hourly data.
	‚Ä¢	Uses thresholds (wind speed, rain probability, storm warning flags) to trigger alerts.
	‚Ä¢	Desktop notifications via plyer, toast, or native OS hooks.
	‚Ä¢	Background process with polling logic.
	‚Ä¢	Configurable frequency and severity filters.

**Self Assessment**

‚óè **After working through the spec, what was the biggest or most unexpected change you
had to make from your sketch?** Likely the amount of integration needed between different apps. This clearly isn't all in Python but knowing the actual necessary inputs was eye opening. 

**‚óè How confident do you feel that you can implement the spec as it's written right now?** I feel like as long as I take this step by step, I shoudl be ok.

**‚óè What is the biggest potential problem that you NEED to solve (or you‚Äôll fail)?** If some integrations or APIs end up not being free, I'll have to find viable work arounds. 

**‚óè What parts are you least familiar with and might need my help?** Uhhh probably anything not named Python
