Project Title: WeatherWise — Your Personal Weather Dashboard

WeatherWise is a simple yet powerful desktop application designed to bring real-time weather forecasting and historical weather data directly to your screen. Built with Python and powered by the Open-Meteo API, this app makes weather tracking both accessible and user-friendly—even for those who aren’t particularly tech-savvy.

The primary goal of this project is to deliver an intuitive interface for viewing current weather, hourly and daily forecasts, and historical climate trends in any location worldwide. Users will be able to input a city or coordinates, and the application will display up-to-date information like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and even UV index. For weather enthusiasts and casual users alike, this tool provides everything needed to plan their day—or week—accordingly.

In version 1, WeatherWise will be developed as a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, allowing users to enter commands like weather --location "New York" or forecast --days 5 --location "Los Angeles". It will fetch data from the Open-Meteo API and output clean, human-readable summaries in the terminal. This minimal version ensures rapid development and testing without needing to design a user interface initially.

Eventually, the application will evolve into a full-featured desktop GUI using Python’s tkinter library, providing a clickable interface with maps, charts, and forecast timelines. For a more modern experience, a web version may be considered, using Flask as the backend and a lightweight frontend framework such as Streamlit or plain HTML/CSS templates enhanced with Bootstrap for responsiveness and design consistency.

WeatherWise will rely on external mechanisms such as RESTful API calls to Open-Meteo, JSON parsing, and optional email integration for daily weather summaries. With the flexibility of Python and the robustness of open weather APIs, this app aims to be both a practical daily tool and a stepping stone into more advanced data visualization projects.
